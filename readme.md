Achievement Summary:
1) The project implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
These operations are defined in calculator/operations/basic_operations.py

2) Proper exception handling for division by zero is implemented, with tests ensuring that a ValueError is raised as expected.
Exception handling is implemented in the Divide class in calculator/operations/basic_operations.py

3) The project effectively uses static methods, class methods, and instance methods across its components.
Static Methods: Used in CalculatorService for performing operations.
Class Methods: Used in CalculationHistory for managing the history of calculations.
Instance Methods: Used in operation classes (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) for performing specific arithmetic operations.
Static and class methods are in calculator/services/calculator_service.py and calculator/repositories/calculation_history.py, respectively. Instance methods are in operation classes within calculator/operations/basic_operations.py

4) A Calculation class that encapsulates details of arithmetic operations, including operands and the result.
Implemented in calculator/models/calculation.py

5) The project maintains a history of calculations, allowing for retrieval of past operations.
This functionality is provided by the CalculationHistory class in calculator/repositories/calculation_history.py

6) Convenience methods for adding to history, retrieving the last calculation, and clearing history are implemented.
These methods are part of the CalculationHistory class in calculator/repositories/calculation_history.py

7) The project utilizes pytest's parameterized tests to efficiently test functions with multiple sets of inputs.
Parameterized tests are used extensively in tests/operations/test_basic_operations.py to test all arithmetic operations with various inputs, including testing for divide by zero exceptions.
